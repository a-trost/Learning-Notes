# Thomas Frank's Productivity Masterclass

Notes taken from watching his class here: https://skl.sh/2Xqb2Fy

## Todoist

His system sounds a lot like GTD, in that you use a calendar for set events like meetings, while tasks go into a different system. 

Organize into projects

## Calendar

Short periods of time is for quick admin work.

Big free blocks are for Deep Work.

"Life Buckets"
You have a lot of facets to life, friends, school, work, etc. He likes to color code his calendar so it's easy to tell at a glance how balanced his days are. You can also turn things off and on to see just one category.

Create hidden calendars for things like classes at your gym or trivia nights at your local bar. Keep them off but toggle them on when you want to see them.
